Then, we start a design process: we sketch layouts, site-maps, and menu structure. After that, I will present you with a variety of different layouts to receive feedback from you about what you like and what shows the concepts of your company in the best way. We will work together closely on every step of the project to be sure that this is exactly what you need.',
